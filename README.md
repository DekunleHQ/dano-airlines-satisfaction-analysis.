# Dano Airlines Passenger Satisfaction Analysis  


## Project Overview
This project analyzes survey data from 120,000+ airline passengers to uncover the main drivers of customer satisfaction and provide recommendations for improving Dano Airlines’ performance. The dataset includes passenger demographics, travel type, flight details, and service ratings.      

# Objective  
Satisfaction at Dano Airlines recently dropped below 50% for the first time. The goal of this analysis is to identify the key areas affecting satisfaction and recommend actionable strategies for improvement.  

## Process
Cleaned and explored the dataset.  
Calculated satisfaction gaps between satisfied and dissatisfied passengers for each service factor.  
Compared these gaps across demographics (customer type, class, age groups).  
Identified the strongest drivers of satisfaction.  
Summarized findings into a one-page report/dashboard.  

## Key Insights
Online Boarding is the most influential driver across nearly all passenger groups.  
In-Flight Entertainment and Seat Comfort are the next strongest levers of satisfaction.  
On-Board Service and Leg Room matter more for premium and older passengers.  
First-time flyers are  significantly less satisfied than other groups, highlighting the need to improve first impressions.  

## Recommendations
Streamline the boarding process with faster, more intuitive digital systems.  
Upgrade seat comfort in Economy and Economy Plus, with affordable legroom options.  
Strengthen on-board service through crew training and consistency.  
Design better experiences for first-time and leisure travelers to rebuild trust.
